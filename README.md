### Date created
The bike log project was created on Feb. 1st, 2021

### Project Title
The new title of the bikeshare project is bikelog_info.

This project tracks bike ride sharing information. This information includes (but is not limited too): duration of rental, most popular start and stop locations for renting/returning, most popular time of day for rentals, most popular day, week and month of rentals, possibly renters gender and age, among other information.

### Files used
The files used were information regarding bicycle rentals in three major cities:
1. Chicago
2. New York City
3. Washington D.C.

### Credits
I really don't have anyone to credit outside of Udacity for this.
